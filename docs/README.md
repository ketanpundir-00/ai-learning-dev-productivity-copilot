## 🚀 Overview

Learning to code and developing software is often slow and frustrating due to fragmented resources, complex documentation, and unclear error messages.  
This project proposes an **AI Learning & Developer Productivity Copilot** that acts as a personal mentor throughout the learning and coding journey.

The platform provides:
- Clear, step-by-step explanations of programming concepts  
- Guided debugging with root-cause analysis  
- Concise summaries of long technical documentation  
- Personalized learning paths based on user skill level and goals  
- Code quality improvement suggestions using best practices  

All capabilities are delivered through a **single conversational interface**.

## 🎯 Problem Statement

Students and beginner developers spend more time **searching for answers** than **learning or building**.  
Existing tools either provide generic content or solve problems without helping users truly understand them.

## 💡 Solution

An AI-powered copilot that:
- Teaches concepts, not just answers questions  
- Explains *why* errors occur and *how* to fix them  
- Adapts explanations and guidance to the user’s skill level  
- Reduces context switching and learning friction
